    <h2>What is psychedelic-assisted psychotherapy?</h2>
  </article>

  <article class="what">
    Psychedelic-assisted psychotherapy is an alternate, more natural method of treating mental illnesses as opposed to more mainstream types of care, such as the use of pharmaceutical antidepressants.
</article>

<article class="what">
This treatment refers to the consumption of hallucinogenic drugs such as psilocybin mushrooms, LSD, MDMA and ayahuasca in order to assist the patient during their ongoing therapeutic counselling with a trained professional.
It has been proven in many studies that the use of psychedelic substances in conjunction with psychotherapy can improve oneâ€™s mental health and general well-being by drastically improving their symptoms of various mental health disorders, leading them to experience greater mindfulness, and helping them to encounter healthier mental breakthroughs.

    <h2>How does it work?</h2>
  </article>

  <article class="how">
    Psychedelic-induced therapy sessions have shown to increase the amount of connectivity patterns in the brain than during other conscious states. Moreover, the use of hallucinogenic drugs is associated with higher cognitive flexibility and heightened sense of self-awareness. In fact, psychedelic-induced brain connections are richer and more diverse than those in non-psychedelic states (Carhart-Harris, et al., par. 1). Depending on which mental illness you are fighting, different psychedelics are useful for different disorders. For example, MDMA is especially useful for PTSD patients as it helps them process and resolve their psychological trauma without experiencing any considerable damage to their mental state (Bui, et al., par. 14). To continue, LSD-assisted psychotherapy can lead to a significant decrease in common anxiety symptoms in the long term, even after only one session (par. 17), and psilocybin mushrooms most commonly leads to long term effects of mindfulness and serenity (Nichols, par. 39).
