    <h3>MDMA</h3>
    <article class="description">
      Commonly known as methylenedioxymethamphetamine, MDMA consumed in the presence of a trained expert can facilitate individuals to have healthier mental breakthroughs. In truth, mentally ill patients often experience difficulty making decisions or working through their problems in a healthy manner since their thoughts are so cluttered and invasive. However, MDMA consumption during psychotherapy has been found to be very effective especially towards patients diagnosed with PTSD as it helps them process and resolve their psychological trauma without experiencing any considerable damage or harm to their mental state (Bui, et al., par. 14). As an example, a recently conducted study has proven that this treatment can aid individuals to process their trauma without encountering major fear responses, such as defensiveness, distress and dissociation, while still having full access to their traumatic memories (Morgan, par. 9). Furthermore, the use of MDMA in conjunction with therapy makes it easier for them stay emotionally engaged with their thoughts during the session, which greatly helps in the processing stage of the treatment (par. 9).
